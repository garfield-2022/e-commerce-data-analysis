# E-commerce-data-analysis
A SQL Tableau project

Credits of data and partial insights go to Diko Hary Adhanto "Data Analysis for E-Commerce Challenge" https://medium.com/diko-hary-adhanto-portfolio/data-analysis-for-e-commerce-challenge-a8d04f756132

The goal of the project is to find answers to the following three questions:
1.	How is the business doing so far?
2.	Where are the problems from if there are any?
3.	What are the potential gaps where the business could grow?

Insights from the data:
1.	Within both years 2019 and 2020, both transaction and transaction values increase month-over-month. January is the lowest. December is the highest. For the first 5 months in 2020, both transaction and transaction values exceed those in 2019 correspondingly. The business is growing rapidly.
2.	Monthly active users grow similarly to revenue growth. From about only 100 in Jan 2019 to close to 8K in Dec 2019. The most current number is about 10K in May 2020.
3.	Gmail.com, hotmail.com and yahoo.com are the top 3 email domains where the revenue comes from. Their contribution weighs equally. Revenue from those three domains make up about 1/3 of total revenue. They are also the top 3 domains where the buyers are from. Their contribution weighs equally too. Altogether they make up about half of total buyers. The business needs to maintain the current status while increasing purchase amount from other domains as well.
4.	Among all the orders placed, about 87% are completed, about 7% are unpaid, and about 6% are paid but undelivered. Those are the areas where the business needs to improve.
